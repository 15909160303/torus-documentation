Integrating with the Torus Wallet gives you a provider, which can be wrapped by
the Web3. This instance functions similar to that as Metamask's Web3 provider.
We have taken great care to make it compatible with Metamask's Web3 interface.

```js
import Web3 from "web3";
const web3 = new Web3(torus.provider);
```
