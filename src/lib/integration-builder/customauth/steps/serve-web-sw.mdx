Serve
[service worker](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-web-sdk/blob/master/serviceworker/sw.js)
from `baseUrl` where `baseUrl` is the one passed to `DirectWebSdk` in the
previous step (example `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker`).

If you're already using a service worker, please ensure to port over the fetch
override from our
[service worker](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-web-sdk/blob/master/serviceworker/sw.js).
