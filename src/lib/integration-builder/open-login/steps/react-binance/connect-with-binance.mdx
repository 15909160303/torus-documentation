title: Connecting with binance smart chain and using private key
---

After calling `openlogin.login`, your application will
have access to the user's private key at `openlogin.privKey`.

In this example, we are first connecting with binance smart chain and
using private key to import a account and to fetch account's balance
from blockchain.

```js
  async function importUserAccount(privateKey) {
    const web3 = new Web3('https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443');
    const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey)
    let balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(account.address);
    let address = account.address;
    setUserAccountInfo({balance, address});
  }
```
