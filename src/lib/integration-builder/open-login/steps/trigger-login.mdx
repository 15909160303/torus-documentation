title: Trigger user login
---

Call `openlogin.login` to trigger user login flow where it's appropriate in your
application lifecycle.

```js
await openlogin.login({
  loginProvider: "google", // Specify a login method to be used
  redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3000", // Where the result will be redirected back after the user logged in
});
```

`openlogin.login` redirects your application to openlogin.com for user to
authenticate then redirect to `redirectUrl` that you provided.
