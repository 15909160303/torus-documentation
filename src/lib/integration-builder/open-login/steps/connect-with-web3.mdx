title: Connect with Web3/ether.js
---

Integrating with OpenLogin gives you a provider and a private key, which can be
wrapped by the Web3. This instance functions similar to Metamask's Web3 provider
and allows you to interact with Ethereum.

```js
const web3 = new Web3(OpenLogin.provider);
const address = await web3.eth.privateKeyToAccount(openlogin.privKey);
```
