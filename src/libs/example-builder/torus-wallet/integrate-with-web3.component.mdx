### Integrate with Web3/ether.js

Integrating with the Torus Wallet gives you a provider, which can be wrapped by
the Web3. This instance functions similar to that as Metamask's web3 provider,
and we have taken great care to make it compatible with Metamask's
[Web3 APIs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/).

```js
import Web3 from "web3";
const web3 = new Web3(torus.provider);
```
