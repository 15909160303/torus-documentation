### Serve redirect page

For browsers where service workers are not supported (or if you wish to not use
service workers), create and serve
[redirect page](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-web-sdk/blob/master/serviceworker/redirect.html)
from `baseUrl/redirect` where `baseUrl` is the one passed while instantiating
`DirectWebSdk` in the next step (example `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker`).

At verifier's interface (where you obtain client id), please use
`baseUrl/redirect` (eg: `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect`) as the
`redirect_uri` where `baseUrl` is the one passed while instantiating
`DirectWebSdk` in the next step.
