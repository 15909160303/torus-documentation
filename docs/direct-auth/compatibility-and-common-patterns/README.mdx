title: Compatibility and Common Patterns
---

The small API surface also means DirectAuth is composable - you can combine it
with a meta-transaction flows, multisigs, and other cryptographic protocols.
It's easy to build on top of and generally we fit with most other technology
stacks.

This section briefly outlines techniques and patterns that applications have
used in their key management architecture:

- [**Gasless/Meta Transactions**](gasless-meta-transactions.mdx)
- [**Scalability Solutions**](scalability-layer2-solutions.mdx)
- [**Password Manager Flow**](password-manager-flow.mdx)
- [**Threshold Device Key Management**](untitled.mdx)
- **Session Management**
- **Different Elliptic Curve/Key Derivation**

For some of these patterns we have tools to/templated implementations which make
implementing these complex patterns/architectures easier. Do get in contact to
find out more!
