## More Details

### Torus Wallet

The Torus Wallet allows any application to seamlessly support their user's
interactions with Ethereum (and similar EVM chains). It comes with a prebuilt
UI, OAuth logins, fiat-to-crypto, whitelabel and
[much more](torus-wallet/features/list-of-features).

If your application is already compatible with Metamask/other Web3 providers,
integrating the Torus Wallet would give you a provider to wrap the same Web3
interface. You can install via
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toruslabs/torus-embed),
[ipfs](torus-wallet/quick-start.mdx#ipfs),
[jsdelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@toruslabs/torus-embed), or
[unpkg](https://unpkg.com/@toruslabs/torus-embed)
([see more details](torus-wallet/quick-start)).

### DirectAuth

Distributed Key Generation as a Service: applications can directly interact with
the Torus Network to assign, store and retrieve keys on the network. Whilst
abstracting key management from your application, the integration is compatible
with both web and native apps, blockchain agnostic, and there are no longer any
pop-ups - your application will have full control of the permissions flow
([see more details](direct-auth/what-is-directauth)).

If you're looking to control your UX, from logins to every interaction,
DirectAuth is the integration for you. You can
[integrate via one of our SDKs](direct-auth/integrating-directauth/README)
depending on the platform(s) you are building on.
