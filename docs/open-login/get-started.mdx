OpenLogin is the first authentication suite to combine the simplicity of passwordless authentication with the security of
non-custodial public key infrastructure (PKI). It brings the ease of passwordless, SSO, biometric authentication to any native
mobile or web applications. OpenLogin makes crypto-friendly FaceID or FingerprintID possible. Also, for web2 developers looking
for more security guarantees, GDPR, CPRA, or CCPA compliance, OpenLogin creates a better way to give users the features they love
without sacrificing security.
