title: What is OpenLogin?
---
OpenLogin is a plug n play auth suite that combines the simplicity of passwordless authentication with the security of
non-custodial public key infrastructure (PKI). It brings the ease of passwordless, SSO, biometric authentication to any native
mobile or web applications.

It makes crypto-friendly FaceID or FingerprintID possible. Also, for web2 developers looking
for more security guarantees, GDPR, CPRA, or CCPA compliance, OpenLogin creates a better way to give users the features they love
without sacrificing security. To experience it for yourself checkout [app.openlogin.com](app.openlogin.com).
